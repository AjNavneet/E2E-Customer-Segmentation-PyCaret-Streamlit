# End to End Customer Segmentation using PyCaret and Streamlit

## Business Objective

Customers are crucial for any organization, and customer retention is key for long-term success. This project focuses on customer segmentation leveraging predictive modeling, data visualization, and segmentation to optimize marketing efforts.

---

## Data Description

The dataset, named 'jewellery,' includes customer profiles with attributes like age, income, spending score, and savings. We aim to classify customers into segments for targeted marketing. 

---

## Aim

Build an end-to-end unsupervised solution for customer segmentation using PyCaret to categorize customers into segments and deploy the model using Streamlit.

---

## Tech Stack

- Language: `Python`
- Libraries: `PyCaret`, `Pandas`, `Streamlit`
